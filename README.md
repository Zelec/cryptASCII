# cryptASCII
An Enigma-esque program in python2.7 that displaces text with ASCII (Hello, World with a displacement of 2 is Jgnnq."Yqtnf#) This was done as a school project, Feel free to do as you like.

Settings are located in the cryptSettings.py file

There is a transmitter and reciever for a proof of concept (uses sockets and encrypts the data, only works in linux).

cryptASCII should work with any system with python2 installed.
